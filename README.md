# RobotFrameworkTester

Example of tests made with Robotframework and Selenium2library.
There are two test cases for logging to github.com:
1) TC_01 - TC_01 - Try to LogIn to Github.com using valid credentials
2) TC_02 - Try to LogIn to Github.com using NOT valid credentials (wrong password)

As a result Robotframework prepare typical for it: log.html, report.html and output.xml files

It is shown here ->> https://github.com/Rosstester/SeleniumPythonTester , how to prepare, more or less the same test cases, using Python and Selenium webdriver (Firefox).
